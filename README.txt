Welcome to the bone zone, I figured I'd finally force myself to learn python and at the same time make a tool to go along with my character tool.

This thing does what it says on the tin, it changes the names of images, and makes thumbnails. If I manage to swing it this thing will also be able to generate code for the Character Tool, but that's a later me problem and I'm not even totally sure if I'll be able to do what I've set out to do already.

For refrence, this is my first major foray into python.
