Welcome to the bone zone, I figured I'd finally force myself to learn python and at the same time make a tool to go along with my character tool.

This thing does what it says on the tin, it changes the names of images, and makes thumbnails. If I manage to swing it this thing will also be able to generate code for the Character Tool, but that's a later me problem and I'm not even totally sure if I'll be able to do what I've set out to do already.

For refrence, this is my first major foray into python.

Compatible with jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff

Please keep in mind that this program will not drill into any files within the input folder
Currently you can run this program 2 ways:
1. from source using python (req. python 3 + pillow)
2. using the frozen version avalible through Namenail_Release

as of now there is only a release version avalible for Mac, sometime later today I'll add a linux version, I don't currently have access to a windows machine so I may not be able to provide a windows executable unless someone with a windows machine is willing to make a release version from the source code.
(Atm I use auto py to exe)


````````````````````````
If you're using python:
- Download the source code
- make sure you have a version of python 3 and pillow installed
- place your images in the input folder
- run Namenail.py and follow the propts
the images will be copied and renamed into the output folder, including a subfolder in the output with the thumbnails.


````````````````````````
If you're using the frozen version:
- download the latest release
- extract the file, making sure the executable and internal files are kept in the same folder
- place the images you want renamed into the input subfolder, located within the internal folder.
- run the program and follow the prompts
the images will be copied and renamed into the output subfolder, including another subfolder in the output with the thumbnails.
